### 1. You're starting a new business: a car rent company. You need a simple system to start controlling car rent. So, develop a Python programme to:
- Ask the user for information on the rentals: customer name, gender (F - Female, M - Male), license plate of the rented car, number of kilometres hired, number of days hired;
- Calculate and print the license plate and total amount to be paid for EACH customer, taking into account that BRL 70.00 will be charged for each day hired and BRL 0.10 for each kilometre hired;
- Calculate and print the average number of kilometres contracted by customers;
- Calculate and print the names of the female clients who have booked rentals of more than 7 days.
